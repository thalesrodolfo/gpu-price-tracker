# GpuPriceTracker

A personal application to send me the best prices of gpu through some accounts on twitter. It was used when I was looking for a new gpu for me :)

Basically it keeps monitoring some accounts on twitter that posts abount gpu deals (in Brazil) and then send a notification to my telegram. This application was deployed on amazon and was deactivated when I bought my new gpu.
